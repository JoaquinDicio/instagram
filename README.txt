Hello! How's it going?

First of all I wanted to thank you for giving me the opportunity to reach this first stage.
Second, I'd like to mention that your "no live technical testing" policy is the best I've 
ever heard.

Having say that, I built this project the best possible way, thinking about the real Instagram in 
some cases, and leaving the door open for future updates. I'll definitely re-build this
instagram-clone using Bootstrap and React so I can add it to my personal porfolio.

I enjoyed so much this test, I hope you enjoy the final result.
